# Newsletter Sign-up Form with Success Message

This is a simple newsletter sign-up form with a success message solution created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to input their email address, submit the form, and see a success message if the submission is successful. Additionally, it provides form validation to handle empty fields and incorrectly formatted email addresses.
